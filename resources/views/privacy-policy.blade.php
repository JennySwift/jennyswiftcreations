    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last modified: 31/03/2016</p>

    I respect your privacy and really want you to be comfortable using my creations. :)

    If you are not comfortable, or you have any questions, please email me at <a href="mailto:jennyswiftcreations@gmail.com">jennyswiftcreations@gmail.com</a>.

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy may change. Please note that your continued use of <a href="http://jennyswiftcreations.com/">http://jennyswiftcreations.com</a> and it's subdomains (such as <a href="http://tracker.jennyswiftcreations.com/">http://tracker.jennyswiftcreations.com</a> or <a href="http://budget_app.jennyswiftcreations.com">http://budget_app.jennyswiftcreations.com</a>) means that you agree with the new privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>What I collect from you</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>The details you enter upon registration</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>I need these details so that you can use my applications. Without them you would not be able to sign in.</li>
                <li>I may also use these details to get in touch with you. For example, if there is an issue regarding my application, to request feedback on your experience using it, to thank you for using my app, or to say 'hi.' :)</li>
                <li>I may also use your email address with the <a href="https://en.gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a> service. This allows me to use your profile info, for example, to display your profile picture to you and other users of my apps.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Data that you enter into my applications</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The data that you enter into my applications is stored in my databases. If it wasn't, you would lose all of your data whenever you refreshed the page in your browser. That wouldn't be very helpful. :)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who I share it with</h2>
    <p>I respect that your data may be confidential and will try not to let others see it, unless I receive your permission (although there are exceptions, mentioned here). Actually, I am uncomfortable with the fact that I have access to your data. But I need to have access to it in order for my applications to work. I may also view it in order to try to improve my applications and become a better programmer, or to see how much my apps are getting used.</p>
    <p>Unless you tell me otherwise, I will assume any communication with me does not contain confidential information, and I may share it. For example, if you send me a feature request, I may share it with friends, family, or other programmers for brainstorming.</p>
    <p>And of course if you choose to share something, (for example, if you create a project with another user of my tracker app) it will be shared with whom you choose to share it with.</p>
    <p>In order to provide real-time functionality to my apps, I use the <a href="https://pusher.com/">Pusher</a> service, a third-party solution, to transfer data. You can view their privacy policy
        <a href="https://pusher.com/legal/privacy">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>CloudFlare</h2>
    <p>I use <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a>, a service that improves the performance and security of websites, as well as provides site analytics.</p>

    <p>They sometimes log user interactions, and they may aggregate user data. For example, they may assemble data to determine how spiders crawl the Internet and whether they are engaged in malicious activity, to detect threats so as to stop future attacks, or to populate things like the CloudFlare Analytics page which includes numbers of hits, page views, bandwidth consumed and unique visitors. Public data such as log files of site visitors may be included in the aggregate data, reports and statistics.</p>

    <p>For more info, see <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/security-policy">their privacy policy</a> and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/what-cloudflare-logs/">this blog post</a>.</p>

    <h2>Data backups</h2>
    <p>I take backups of my databases. I may store them on any/all of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.copy.com/page/home;section:landing">Copy</a></li>
        <li>My Mac</li>
        <li>An external hard drive</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Passwords are stored encrypted in my databases.</p>
    <p>I don't use SSL. I may use it in the future. Please let me know if this is a high priority for you.</p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>My sites use cookies for things such as handling sessions and authentication. CloudFlare uses a cookie which can be read about
        <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-What-does-the-CloudFlare-cfduid-cookie-do-">here.</a> You can disable cookies in your browser settings, but doing so may cause negative effects, such as the 'remember me' feature on the login pages not working.</p>

    <h2>Google Analytics</h2>
    <p>My sites use <a href="https://analytics.google.com">Google Analytics,</a> which tracks all sorts of things such as how many visits my sites receive, how long visitors stay on a page, what links are clicked when visitors arrive on my pages, search terms that led to page visits, etc.</p>

    <h2>Access and Correction</h2>
    <p>If you find that any information I hold about you is incorrect, please let me know.

    <h2>Complaints Handling</h2>
    <p>If you have any complaints or feel that there has been a breach of the <a href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/images/documents/privacy/privacy-resources/privacy-fact-sheets/privacy-fact-sheet-17-australian-privacy-principles_2.pdf">Australian Privacy Principles</a>, or a registered APP code, you can contact me at <a href="mailto:jennyswiftcreations@gmail.com">jennyswiftcreations@gmail.com</a>. You will likely hear back from me within a few days.</p>
    <p>If you are not satisfied with the process of making a complaint to me, you may make a complaint to the Information Commissioner on the details below:<br />Office of the Australian Information Commissioner<br />GPO Box 5218 Sydney NSW 2001 <br />Email: <a href="mailto:enquiries@oaic.gov.au">enquiries@oaic.gov.au</a> <br />Telephone: 1300 363 992 <br />Fax: 02 9284 9666</p>

    <h2>Demo Versions</h2>
    <p>Please be aware that for the demo versions of my apps, other people who use the demo may see the data you enter, although the data does get reset regularly.</p>
