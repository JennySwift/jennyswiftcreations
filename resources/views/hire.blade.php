		<h1>Hire</h1>

		<p>I’m a junior full-stack web developer. I love working remotely. I’m not quite sure why more companies don’t
			allow it, when pretty much all I need is my computer and an internet connection. Perhaps my cleaner friend
			put it better: I “could work while sitting on the toilet."<img src="emoticons/happy-laugh.png" class="emoticon"></p>



		<p>So if you have work I can do on the toilet...kidding. ;)</p>
		<p>If you have remote work for me, I’d love to hear from you.</p>

		<p>But if you have work for me that can’t be done remotely, I’d still like to hear from you.</p>
