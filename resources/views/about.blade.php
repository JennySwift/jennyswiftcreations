	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>I spent 13 years of my life as a tennis player. Tennis made me who I am.</p>

	<p>I started playing when I was almost 7. At 10, I started homeschooling because I wasn’t satisfied with the school
		system. This gave me the chance to play more often, and my mum would take me to practice with our ball machine.
		I entered some tournaments and won, so I entered some more, and kept winning. Naturally, I liked winning, and it
		fed my desire to improve.</p>

	</div>

	<p>Actually, losing fed my desire to improve, too, perhaps more so than winning. At 11, after losing to the number 1 seed in the quarterfinals of the New South Wales state championships, I was inspired by the level of my opponent and wanted to practice more, so that I’d get as good as her.</p>

	<p>At 12, I won that same tournament, becoming state champion on my birthday, and later that year, I became national champion. I still have the tennis balls, the string that was in my racquet during the final, and…my fingernails. Sentimental stuff. :)</p>

	<p>While still 12, I played inter-district above my age in the 14s, and was undefeated at singles throughout the whole season. I was voted winner of the Ken Rosewall best and fairest award. I also played for Australia in a teams event against New Zealand, and again, two years later. We won on both occasions.</p>

	<p>At 14, I was national champion again for my age group. Very fond memories there. I was little compared to my
		opponents and I won with my head and my heart, not my strength. There were many times I looked down and out,
		but, somehow, found a way to win. A point here or there could have made the difference between me losing early
		on, and winning the tournament. I didn't keep my fingernails for this one, though. ;)</p>

	<p>My fondest tennis memories are those with my mum and dad. My dad was my coach, and we spent many, many hours on
		the tennis court together. Although unqualified as a tennis coach, he made an awesome one because he was smart and dedicated.
		When he was able to take time off work to come with me to tournaments, I played better. I don’t think I would
		have had anywhere near the success I did if it wasn’t for my dad. And my mum was an awesome help, too. We had
		fun times, driving off to some country tournament together, having a bit of an adventure. We’d take our ball
		machine when my dad couldn’t join us, and she’d pick up the balls for me.</p>

	<p>My dad and I would also compete together, and my mum would cheer us on. We had some good wins, and for days afterwards, we’d still be celebrating, repeatedly saying things like, “Hey, we won, Dad!” “Yeah, Jen, we won!” with big grins on our faces, and as if saying it for the first time after the event. Or we'd remind each other of the big shots we did that brought us to victory, reliving the moment.</p>

	<p>After winning the 12s and 14s nationals when I was 12 and 14, I made it my goal to win the 16s a year ahead of
		‘schedule.’ I achieved this at 15, winning a tough three set final against a girl I’d never beaten before. I was
		ecstatic.</p>

		<p class="img-description">One for singles, one for doubles (with Emelyn Starr, whose humour helped me during the singles final, when the pressure of the situation was making me feel nervous), and one I didn't get to keep. I think they engraved my name on it.</p>
	</div>

	<p>I then began to travel the country on my own to play, and at 17, the world. While still 15, I won a couple of international tournaments for girls under 19.</p>

	<p>I have some funny memories from my years as a tennis player. I wore shin pads during a match (a temporary solution until I learned how to serve without whacking my leg in the process). I wore toy handcuffs during practice. (It helped my forehand.) I walked on the court for a match, before learning I had my shirt inside out. (Oops. :)) And I’d dance to the Beatles in the girls’ toilets, as somewhat of a pre-match routine, while on my way to claiming one of my international titles-perhaps I should have kept it up. :)</p>

	<p>I had similar success at doubles as I did at singles. I enjoyed the team aspect of it, and it was often more fun-fun, rather than serious-fun. I remember one doubles match with Emelyn Starr, where I was playing below average, feeling a strange kind of exhaustion-as if my laughing muscles were overworked. :)</p>

	<p>What started out as ‘homeschooling’ would often be ‘awayschooling.’ I finished a few years ‘late,’ but
		got there eventually. My favourite subjects were French and Shorthand-I had a love for learning languages.</p>

	<p>Over the years, there were times I felt like quitting tennis, where I was sick of hitting tennis balls again, and
		again, and again, or I wondered what else there was to life that I was missing out on, since tennis was my life.
		But through talking it out with my parents, they would help me regain my motivation (They helped me see tennis as training for life-that the things required for tennis, such as dedication, patience, or perseverance, could come in handy later on.), and so I kept going.</p>

	<p>It was a very lonely lifestyle, being away from home so much, and on my own. One time when I was really
		struggling with homesickness, it was my mum who was asking the question if I really wanted to keep going. I
		loved the tennis too much to quit-it felt like a relationship to me-by making it through the hard times
		previously, we’d become so close-I was too attached to say, ‘Goodbye.'</p>

	<p>My serve was the weaker part of my game, and being shorter than my opponents didn’t help. And although I
		generally excelled under pressure, playing in front of, what felt to me, large crowds, was a different story. I
		remember being in New Zealand, and I’d been having trouble with my serve. As was often the case, I had no coach
		with me. (I tried to coach myself.) I was playing a doubles final, and I was serving to try and stay in the
		match, in front of what felt like a big audience. I did the biggest choke I’d ever done, to lose the match. I’d
		let my partner and myself down. I’d let the crowd down. And doing four double faults to lose the match, with
		lots of people watching, didn’t exactly feel nice on the ego. I retreated to a place of solitude, and cried.
		:)</p>

	<p>On another occasion, in England this time, my serve let me down again, big time. I remember being on the phone
		to my dad, in tears. There was pressure in going all the way to England to play-I felt like I had to win to make it worth it, and I didn't want to let my parents down. Feeling like I could have won, if it wasn’t for my serve, was killing me
		inside. I’d had enough. I had to do something about it. I didn’t know how, but I was going to.</p>

	<p>Eventually, my serve became my strength. I think it was due to a number of things, in particular, my resolve to
		turn things around, and a very helpful tip from my footwork coach, David Bailey, that I’d never heard from any
		other coach. Instead of feeling like I was losing matches that I could have won if it wasn’t for my serve, I
		felt like I was winning matches that I could have lost if it wasn’t for my serve. I got a huge kick out of
		turning things around like that.</p>

	<p>By 18, the competition seemed to get harder. Somehow, I made it to the final of the nationals. I think I surprised myself, and
		probably others. I was playing the best tennis of my life, and I had to. I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t have made it
		that far without my dad there. The final was a memorable tragedy-well, at least from my point of view. I won the first set comfortably (So, apparently, it wasn't that 'memorable'-I don't remember the score. :P),
		and was up 2-0 in the second, and all of a sudden, out of the blue, my game lost its oomph. I lost, and it was quite a mystery
		what happened to me.</p>

	<p>Looking back, I think it was a sign of what was to come. Others won with power. For me to win, it took
		endurance, running down my opponents’ big shots all the time, until they’d lose patience. It took more of a toll
		on my body. Apparently, my body wouldn’t be able to keep that up, year after year.</p>

	<p>I got a lot of injuries over the years. One of them was just after winning a tournament on my 19th birthday, and
		I was playing the best tennis of my life. I wanted to turn pro, and I knew I was running out of time. And so,
		being setback from yet another injury, needing to take time off tennis, after all my hard work, broke my heart.</p>

	<p>Having that time away from tennis gave me more time to think about deeper things than, for example, improving my forehand. (It still needed improving-handcuffs alone weren't enough. :P) Thoughts that the demands of my tennis life didn’t allow for, that I once had to bury, were given the chance to come to the surface. I began to find problems with the faith I had been brought up with. I didn’t know how to handle my faith not making sense, and I fell apart.</p>

	<p>Eventually, I recovered from my injury and started playing
		again. I won quite a few more titles, but, feeling the pressure of time running out for me to ‘make it,' and not
		wanting to think myself a failure, I pushed myself really, really hard, but apparently, way too hard. I think a combination of
		that, and other things (I don’t think I’ll be eating chicken ever again.), led to me nearly losing my
		life, or so it felt.</p>

	<p>This turn of events forced me to say, ‘Goodbye’ to tennis, and I now had a new ‘opponent.’ I was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), and over the next few years, I spent a lot of my life in bed. I experienced crazy, crazy symptoms ('Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,' I feel, is a very inadequate name.), and survival felt like a struggle. But I think the depression and anxiety I had previously experienced, as well as my years of trying to find my way through obstacles as a tennis player, really helped me get through those years. And I was grateful to be with my family again, and grateful for their support.</p>

	<p>In an attempt to get well, I didn’t eat for nearly four weeks, and switched to a diet of only plant foods. I’ve now been eating this way for over 7 years, and for most of that time, only raw. I’m not sure if that’s the best way to do it, but it seemed to work better for me during that time.</p>

	<p>The hard times I went through gave me a new joy and appreciation for things that are easy to take for granted.
		Perhaps my favourite-being able to talk. After being unable to do so (one of those 'crazy' symptoms), and unsure if I would ever be able to
		again, being able to talk again was so very, very, very precious. And after feeling dependant on society for so long, longing to contribute, but being unable to, being able to do favours for people, and later, to work, meant a lot to me.</p>

	<p>As I recovered, I spent a lot of time online learning new hobbies-knitting, growing food (I love being in nature.), carving wood, sewing clothes, and playing the ukulele. I discovered I loved to create things. I eventually decided that moving a piece of yarn around in a repetitive motion wasn’t for me, but I think it took me a while to realize that because I was fascinated by the learning process and the creative possibilities.</p>

	<p>	I remember during the harder days of CFS, lying there, feeling like it was (in my own words at the time), “taking all the energy I had just to be.” Or lying down to rest, only a few metres away from my bed, because a few metres felt too far to go. After the number of times I tried to do too much and ‘crashed,’ as we’d call it, taking weeks, or months to recover, I could have resigned myself to thinking that any attempt at an activity was dangerous and pointless, but I didn’t want to feel defeated. I had to be careful, and settle for slow progress (At one point, my 'training' was pedalling the pedals of a stationary bike, just two times around in circle), but I’ve since run distances others would choose to drive (barefoot of course-who needs shoes? ;)).</p>

	<p>As I felt the battle with CFS was subsiding, I actually missed it. I love a challenge, and it felt a bit like my
		‘opponent’ had walked off the court. I am now into calisthenics (bodyweight strength training-I think maybe it’s
		my way of serving aces past CFS, after feeling threatened with match point on several occasions.), and am
		inspired by the ‘impossible’ cool things I see the veterans doing. It might take me longer to get there than
		‘well’ people, but I believe I can do it. And at the time of writing, <a href="http://www.mpcalisthenics.com" target="_blank">my new calisthenics coach</a> thinks I’m just
		weeks away from doing dead-hanging chinups, something I’ve wanted to do for years.</p>

	<p>As my health improved, but I still needed to be at home, I started thinking about possibilities for work. I’d used Google Sketchup to build a model of the backyard, for designing a wedding present (pictured above), and for calculating the floor space for a friend’s apartment. I quite enjoyed that. And I’d noticed, after a period of spending less time at the computer, that I missed learning online. And I loved playing Age of Empires-a strategy computer game. I wished I could have a job that took the same sort of skill, but was, well, useful.
		<img src="emoticons/teeth-grin.png" class="emoticon emoticon-in-text"></p>

	<p>I wasn’t sure if such a job existed, and so I was pretty thrilled to discover coding. I did a two-week free trial at Team Treehouse, which sparked an interest, so I kept going. A few months later, my brother wished there was an app for budgeting with an unsteady income. I took on the challenge, hardly knowing anything at the time. Building this app was pretty much how I learned to code-seeing needs in my app, while taking courses to teach me how to meet those needs. Over time, a passion for coding grew in me and I knew I wanted to keep going.</p>

	<p>To end my story here would feel incomplete. More traumas have come my way. I seem to have somewhat of a knack for meeting with them. Perhaps it’s because I tend to value truth and authenticity over comfort, learning and growing over staying put, and because I tend to challenge the norm, and question the ‘unquestionable.’ Sometimes I lose heart, and I can’t say I’ve made my way through them all. But perhaps I’d be bored if I could say that.</p>

	<p>My traumas have challenged me and changed me. Looking back on my tennis life, it now seems self-centered to me. Directing all my time and energy into becoming a better tennis player, I hadn’t yet discovered the joy of loving those around me. When I felt somewhat on my ‘deathbed,’ I began to wonder what in the world the point of all my achievements was, since I didn’t think I’d be leaving much behind for the world. I hope I can redirect the passion and energy I demonstrated, that brought about my success, to make the world a better place.</p>

	<p>Thank you for reading my story. <img src="emoticons/tennis-ball.png" class="tennis-ball"></p>
