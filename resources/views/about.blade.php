	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>I spent 13 years of my life as a tennis player. Tennis made me who I am.</p>

	<p>I started playing when I was almost 7. At 10, I started homeschooling because I wasn’t satisfied with the school
		system. This gave me the chance to play more often, and my mum would take me to practice with our ball machine.
		I entered some tournaments and won, so I entered some more, and kept winning. Naturally, I liked winning, and it
		fed my desire to improve.</p>

	<p>At 12, I became state champion on my birthday, and later, national champion. I still have the tennis balls, the
		string that was in my racquet during the final, and…my fingernails. Sentimental stuff. :)</p>

	<p>At 14, I was national champion again for my age group. Very fond memories there. I was little compared to my
		opponents and I won with my head and my heart, not my strength. There were many times I looked down and out,
		but, somehow, found a way to win. A point here or there could have made the difference between me losing early
		on and winning the tournament.</p>

	<p>My fondest tennis memories are those with my mum and dad. My dad was my coach and we spent many, many hours on
		the tennis court together. Although unqualified as a tennis coach, he made an awesome one because he was smart and dedicated.
		When he was able to take time off work to come with me to tournaments, I played better. I don’t think I would
		have had anywhere near the success I did if it wasn’t for my dad. And my mum was an awesome help, too. We had
		fun times, driving off to some country tournament together, having a bit of an adventure. We’d take our ball
		machine when my dad couldn’t join us, and she’d pick up the balls for me.</p>

	<p>After winning the 12s and 14s nationals when I was 12 and 14, I made it my goal to win the 16s a year ahead of
		‘schedule.’ I achieved this at 15, winning a tough three set final against a girl I’d never beaten before. I was
		ecstatic.</p>

	<p>I then began to travel the country on my own to play, and at 17, the world. I won a couple of international
		titles, and reached a world ranking of 135 for girls under 19.</p>

	<p>What started out as ‘homeschooling’ would often be ‘awayfromhomeschooling.’ I finished a few years ‘late,’ but
		got there eventually. My favourite subjects were French and Shorthand-I had a love for learning languages.</p>

	<p>Over the years, there were times I felt like quitting tennis, where I was sick of hitting tennis balls again, and
		again, and again, or I wondered what else there was to life that I was missing out on, since tennis was my life.
		But through talking it out with my parents, they would help me regain my motivation, and so I kept going.</p>

	<p>It was a very lonely lifestyle, being away from home so much, and on my own. One time when I was really
		struggling with homesickness, it was my mum who was asking the question if I really wanted to keep going. I
		loved the tennis too much to quit-it felt like a relationship to me-by making it through the hard times
		previously, we’d become so close-I was too attached to say, ‘Goodbye.'</p>

	<p>By 18, the competition seemed to get harder. Somehow, I made it to the final of the nationals. I think I surprised myself and
		probably others. I was playing the best tennis of my life, and I had to. I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t have made it
		that far without my dad there. The final was a memorable tragedy-well, at least from my point of view. I was up
		a set and 2-0, and all of a sudden, out of the blue, my game lost its oomph. I lost and it was quite a mystery
		what happened to me.</p>

	<p>Looking back, I think it was a sign of what was to come. Others won with power. For me to win, it took
		endurance, running down my opponents’ big shots all the time, until they’d lose patience. It took more of a toll
		on my body. Apparently, my body wouldn’t be able to keep that up, year after year.</p>

	<p>I got a lot of injuries over the years. One of them was just after winning a tournament on my 19th birthday, and
		I was playing the best tennis of my life. I wanted to turn pro, and I knew I was running out of time. And so,
		being setback from yet another injury, after all my hard work, broke my heart. I made mistakes during that time
		away from tennis, and turned into an emotional mess. Eventually, I recovered from my injury and started playing
		again. I won quite a few more titles, but feeling the pressure of time running out for me to ‘make it,' and not
		wanting to think myself a failure, I pushed myself really, really hard, but apparently, way too hard. I think
		that, as well as other things (I don’t think I’ll be eating chicken ever again.), led to me nearly losing my
		life, or so it felt.</p>

	<p>Over the next few years, I spent a lot of my life in bed. I experienced crazy, crazy symptoms, and survival felt
		like a struggle. But I think the depression and anxiety I had previously experienced, as well as my years as a
		tennis player, really helped me get through those years. I was grateful to be with my family again, and grateful
		for their support.</p>

	<p>In an attempt to get well, I didn’t eat for nearly four weeks, and switched to a diet of only plant foods. I’ve now been eating this way for over 7 years, and for most of that time, only raw. I’m not sure if that’s the best way to do it, but it seemed to work better for me during that time.</p>

	<p>The hard times I went through gave me a new joy and appreciation for things that are easy to take for granted.
		Perhaps my favourite-being able to talk. After being unable to do so, and unsure if I would ever be able to
		again, being able to talk again was so very, very, very precious.</p>

	<p>As I recovered, I spent a lot of time online learning new hobbies-knitting, growing food (I love being in nature.), carving wood, sewing clothes, and playing the ukulele. I discovered I loved to create things. I eventually decided that moving a piece of yarn around in a repetitive motion wasn’t for me, but I think it took me a while to realize that because I was fascinated by the learning process and the creative possibilities.</p>

	<p>As I felt the battle was subsiding, I actually missed it. I love a challenge, and it felt a bit like my
		‘opponent’ had walked off the court. I am now into calisthenics (bodyweight strength training), and am inspired
		by the ‘impossible’ cool things I see the veterans doing.</p>

	<p>As my health improved, but I still needed to be at home, I started thinking about possibilities for work. I’d used Google Sketchup to build a model of the backyard, for designing a wedding present, and for calculating the floor space for a friend’s apartment. I quite enjoyed that. And I’d noticed, after a period of spending less time at the computer, that I missed learning online. And I loved playing Age of Empires-a strategy game. I wished I could have a job that took the same sort of skill, but was, well, useful.</p>

	<p>I wasn’t sure if such a job existed, and so I was pretty thrilled to discovered coding. I did a two-week free trial at Team Treehouse, which sparked an interest, so I kept going. A few months later, my brother wished there was an app for budgeting with an unsteady income. I took on the challenge, hardly knowing anything at the time. Building this app was pretty much how I learned to code-seeing needs in my app, while taking courses to teach me how to meet those needs. Over time, a passion for coding grew in me and I knew I wanted to keep going.</p>
