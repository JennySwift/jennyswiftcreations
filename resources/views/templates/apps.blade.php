        <h1>Budget App</h1>

        <div class="info-container">
            <p>My first app. Made for my brother. Soon after I began coding, when I didn't know much at all, he wanted something to help him budget when income is unpredictable. Building this app was one of the main ways I learned to code.</p>
            <p>Demo is currently unavailable, sorry.</p>
            {{--<p>It was challenging, probably because I had to learn everything as I was going, and doing everything for the first time. (My other projects have often felt pretty easy compared to this one.) But not only that, we didn't really know what we wanted it to do-we've spent so much time trying to figure that out-and we didn't know much about budgeting. :)</p>--}}
            {{--<p>"Budgeting for people who don't know how to budget" might be a good way to describe this app. ;)</p>--}}
            {{--<p>But we've been using it for quite a while now, and I reckon the basics work well, and the filter is very powerful. There could still be a long way to go till my brother is really happy with it, though.</p>--}}
