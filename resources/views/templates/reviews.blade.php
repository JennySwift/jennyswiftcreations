        <p>To whom it may concern,</p>

        <p>I am privileged to write in support of my dear friend and mentee, Jenny Swift. I have been mentoring Jenny since
            March 2015, remotely via Codementor.io, specifically on PHP and the Laravel framework.</p>

        <p>We began with small sessions in order to help Jenny in the debugging process of her applications. Jenny was
            working on her own projects using Laravel and Angular.js after only a few months of learning code and was
            definitely motivated to improve her programming skills.</p>

        <p>After a few sessions, Jenny told me about her ultimate goal to build a career as a web developer. We then
            decided to start working together on theory of Object Oriented Programming in PHP, design patterns and advanced
            use of Laravel including Test-Driven Development and RESTful API specifications. Her learning speed and
            dedication to improve are astounding. She is always working hard to apply the new concepts learned during our
            sessions into her applications, by refactoring existing features or implementing new ones.</p>

        <p>Not only does Jenny demonstrate commitment and motivation into becoming a web developer, but she also possesses
            rare personal skills with her calmness and empathy, and her practical and realistic reasoning â€” not to mention
            her positive energy.</p>

        <p>Our sessions being remote, her autonomy, great written communication skills, proficiency with version control
            and team organization tools (eg. Git, Trello, Skype, etc.) are definitely appreciated.</p>

        <p>I would strongly recommend Jenny for an entry level or junior position as a PHP developer.</p>

        <p>Sincerely,</p>
